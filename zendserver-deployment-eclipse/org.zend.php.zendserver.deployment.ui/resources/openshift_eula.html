<h1>Zend Technologies Ltd.</h1>
<h2>End-User License Agreement</h2>
<p>This End-User License Agreement (this "Agreement") is a legal contract between <br>
you, as either an individual or a single business entity, and Zend Technologies <br>
Ltd. and its affiliates ("Zend").<br>
<br>
READ THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY <br>
BEFORE DOWNLOADING OR INSTALLING ZEND'S PROPRIETARY <br>
SOFTWARE (THE "SOFTWARE") OR OBTAINING A LICENSE KEY TO THE <br>
SOFTWARE OR USING THE SOFTWARE. THE SOFTWARE IS FURTHER <br>
DEFINED IN AN ORDER DOCUMENT (AN "ORDER"), ENTERED INTO <br>
BETWEEN YOU AND ZEND OR YOU AND A ZEND RESELLER, WHICH SETS <br>
FORTH COMMERCIAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO YOUR PURCHASE OF THE <br>
SOFTWARE.<br>
<br>
THE SOFTWARE IS COPYRIGHTED AND IT IS LICENSED TO YOU UNDER <br>
THIS AGREEMENT AND IS NOT SOLD TO YOU. BY DOWNLOADING, <br>
INSTALLING OR USING THE SOFTWARE OR OBTAINING A LICENSE KEY <br>
TO THE SOFTWARE, OR BY ENTERING INTO AN ORDER WHICH <br>
REFERENCES AND PROVIDES SOURCE INFORMATION NECESSARY FOR <br>
ACCESSING AND REVIEWING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE <br>
THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT, THAT YOU UNDERSTAND IT, <br>
AND THAT YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS. IF <br>
YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS <br>
AGREEMENT, YOU SHOULD TERMINATE THE DOWNLOAD OR <br>
INSTALLATION PROCESS, AND REFRAIN FROM ACCESSING OR USING <br>
THE SOFTWARE. THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY ORDERS, <br>
REPRESENTS THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND ZEND <br>
CONCERNING THE SOFTWARE, AND THIS AGREEMENT SUPERSEDES <br>
AND REPLACES ANY PRIOR PROPOSAL, REPRESENTATION, OR <br>
UNDERSTANDING YOU MAY HAVE HAD WITH ZEND RELATING TO THE <br>
SOFTWARE UNLESS YOU HAVE ENTERED INTO A SEPARATE WRITTEN <br>
AGREEMENT SIGNED BY ZEND THAT EXPRESSLY AMENDS THIS <br>
AGREEMENT.<br>
<br>
1. License<br>
<br>
1.1. Grant of License. Zend hereby grants to you, and you accept, a limited, <br>
nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use the Software in machine-readable, <br>
object code form only, and the user manuals accompanying the Software (the <br>
"Documentation"), only as authorized in this Agreement, and subject to <br>
compliance with the terms of this Agreement, and payment of all applicable <br>
license fees. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Software" includes any <br>
updates, enhancements, modifications, revisions, or additions to the Software <br>
made available to you by Zend. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Zend shall be <br>
under no obligation to provide any updates, enhancements, modifications, <br>
revisions, or additions to the Software. The term of your license is as set forth in <br>
the Order. If the Order does not state a term, then the term of the license shall be <br>
for a period of one (1) year from the earlier of your download or installation of the <br>
Software. The term of your license is renewable on terms set forth in the Order or <br>
otherwise as agreed by Zend.<br>
<br>
1.2. Scope of Use. You may use the Software activated by a license key for the <br>
number of computers (virtual or physical) owned, leased, or otherwise controlled <br>
by you, at rates specified for metered usage or for the number of users, as <br>
specified in an Order. An Order may also specify other applicable license scope <br>
definitions. For purposes of this Agreement, "use" of the Software means loading <br>
the Software into the temporary or permanent memory of a computer and <br>
executing the Software. If you distribute the Software to multiple computers or <br>
users, you must ensure that your usage does not exceed the usage for which <br>
you have paid license fees, or you will be in breach of this Agreement unless the <br>
order is for meter use. If the Order does not state a scope of license, then the <br>
scope of license for the Software shall be for a single user on a single computer <br>
or shall be metered at the applicable rate.<br>
<br>
1.3. Restrictions, Copies and Modifications. You may not reverse engineer, <br>
decompile, disassemble, or otherwise translate the Software or any license keys <br>
you have obtained. You may not modify or adapt the Software or any license <br>
keys that you have obtained in any way. You may make one copy of the <br>
Software, the Documentation, and any license keys that you have obtained, <br>
solely for backup or archival purposes. Any such copies of the Software, <br>
Documentation, or license keys shall include any copyright or other proprietary <br>
notices that were included on such materials when you first received them. <br>
Except as authorized in this Section, no copies of the Software, Documentation, <br>
or license keys, or any portions thereof, may be made or distributed by you or <br>
any person under your authority or control. You may not allow third party use of <br>
the Software or use of the Software as a service bureau.<br>
<br>
1.4. Assignment of Rights. You will not sublicense, lease, rent, or lend your <br>
rights in the Software, Documentation, or license keys, as granted by this <br>
Agreement, to any party without prior written consent of Zend.<br>
1.5. Product Specific Special Terms. The provisions of this Section are <br>
applicable to the specific product mentioned and are exceptions to other <br>
provisions of this Agreement, and serve to modify such provisions only to the <br>
extent such provisions relate to these products.<br>
Zend Server - Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this <br>
Agreement, you are permitted to duplicate and distribute the Zend Server <br>
product, on a standalone basis or combined with other products, provided <br>
(i) you do not make any modifications to Zend Server and distribute the <br>
entire Zend Server product, (ii) you do not modify or remove any <br>
proprietary rights notices or markings, or remove or modify this Agreement <br>
as included in any such distribution, (iii) you clearly indicate that Zend <br>
Server is included in your distribution, (iv) you do not use Zend's name, <br>
logos or trademarks or the name, logos and trademarks of any included <br>
third party software in any way that might state or imply Zend's or a third <br>
party's endorsement of your product, and (v) you do not transfer with any <br>
such copy any license keys for Zend Server. Zend Server distributed <br>
without a license key will operate with only reduced functionality and if a <br>
license key for Zend Server expires and is not renewed, it will continue to <br>
operate with only reduced functionality.  This reduced functionality version <br>
is licensed on a perpetual basis, without charge, subject to compliance <br>
with the terms of this Agreement.<br>
Zend Server Cluster Manager - Zend Server Cluster Manager is not <br>
available for you to distribute.<br>
Zend Studio - Zend Studio is not available for you to distribute. If the <br>
license key for Zend Studio expires and is not renewed for a subscription <br>
or limited term license, Zend Studio will continue to operate with only <br>
reduced functionality. This reduced functionality version is licensed on a <br>
perpetual basis, without charge, subject to compliance with the terms of <br>
this Agreement.<br>
Zend Guard - Zend Guard is not available for you to distribute. However, <br>
you may distribute Zend Optimizer and Zend Guard Loader (the runtime c <br>
components for encoded files) to your end customers, provided that your <br>
end user customers enter into an end user agreement that contains at a <br>
minimum the following provisions covering the Zend embedded <br>
components: (i) prohibits reverse compilation and/or reverse assembly, (ii) <br>
disclaims all warranties, and (iii) disclaims liability for any indirect, <br>
incidental or consequential damages.<br>
 2. Intellectual Property Protection and Confidentiality<br>
<br>
2.1. Use Reporting, License Violations and Remedies. Zend reserves the <br>
right to gather data on license key usage including license key numbers, server <br>
IP addresses, domain counts and other information deemed relevant, to ensure <br>
that our products are being used in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. <br>
Additionally, you agree that Zend may, upon reasonable notice, perform an audit <br>
of your facilities to verify compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Any <br>
unauthorized use shall be considered by Zend to be a violation of this <br>
Agreement. Zend reserves the right to remedy violations immediately upon <br>
discovery, by charging the then-current list price of unauthorized license keys. <br>
This is not a sole remedy for a violation of this Agreement and Zend may <br>
exercise any other remedies available at equity or law. <br>
<br>
2.2. License Automatic Update and Expiration. Your license may include an <br>
expiration date that can result in the termination of the license. For perpetual <br>
license keys, the license updates automatically except if Zend determines that a <br>
license is used in violation of the terms of this Agreement. If your license key is <br>
stolen, or if you suspect any improper or illegal usage of your license key outside <br>
of your control you should promptly notify Zend of such occurrence. A <br>
replacement license will be issued to you and the suspect license will be allowed <br>
to expire. For limited-term licenses, your periodic payment must be processed <br>
prior to the expiration date in order for the license updates to be performed. It is <br>
your responsibility to contact Zend regarding any potential expiration that you <br>
deem inappropriate. Zend shall not be liable for any damages or costs incurred in <br>
connection with the expired licenses.<br>
<br>
2.3. Proprietary Rights to Software and Trademarks. You acknowledge that <br>
the Software and the Documentation are proprietary to Zend, and the Software <br>
and Documentation are protected under United States copyright law and <br>
international treaties. You further acknowledge and agree that, as between you <br>
and Zend, Zend owns and shall continue to own all right, title, and interest in and <br>
to the Software and Documentation, including associated intellectual property <br>
rights under copyright, trade secret, patent, or trademark laws. This Agreement <br>
does not grant you any ownership interest in or to the Software or the <br>
Documentation, but only a limited right of use that is revocable in accordance <br>
with the terms of this Agreement. Any and all trademarks or service marks that <br>
Zend uses in connection with the Software or with services rendered by Zend are <br>
marks owned by Zend. This Agreement does not grant you any right, license, or <br>
interest in such marks, and you shall not assert any right, license, or interest in <br>
such marks or any words or designs that are confusingly similar to such marks.<br>
<br>
2.4. Confidentiality. You shall permit only authorized users, who possess <br>
rightfully obtained license keys, to use the Software or to view the <br>
Documentation. Except as expressly authorized by this Agreement, you shall not <br>
make available the Software, Documentation, or any license key to any third <br>
party. You will use your best efforts to cooperate with and assist Zend in <br>
identifying and preventing any unauthorized use, copying, or disclosure of the <br>
Software, Documentation, or any portion thereof.<br>
<br>
3. License Fees<br>
<br>
The Software will be available to you for use upon your receipt of a license key. <br>
You may obtain one or more license keys by ordering the license keys from Zend <br>
or a Zend reseller, as the case may be. The license fees paid by you for the <br>
license keys are paid in consideration of the license granted under this <br>
Agreement. You shall, in addition to license fees, pay all applicable sales, use, <br>
transfer, or other taxes and all duties, whether national, state, or local, however <br>
designated, that are levied or imposed by reason of your purchase and use of the <br>
Software, excluding income taxes on the net profits of Zend. <br>
4. Software Maintenance and Support Services<br>
<br>
You may elect to purchase Software maintenance and support services by so <br>
ordering from Zend or a Zend reseller and paying the applicable fees.<br>
5. Term and Termination<br>
<br>
This Agreement is effective upon your acceptance of the Agreement, or upon <br>
your downloading, installing, accessing, or using the Software, even if you have <br>
not expressly accepted this Agreement. This Agreement shall continue in effect <br>
until terminated. Without prejudice to any other rights, this Agreement will <br>
terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of the limitations or other <br>
requirements described herein. If you are licensing the Software on a limited term <br>
basis, and fail to pay the applicable license fees or renewal license fees, Zend <br>
shall have the right to interrupt your use of the Software. You may terminate this <br>
Agreement at any time by: (i) providing written notice of your decision to <br>
terminate the Agreement to Zend and (ii) either returning the Software, <br>
Documentation, all copies thereof, and all license keys that you have obtained to <br>
Zend or destroying all such materials and providing written verification of such <br>
destruction to Zend. Zend may terminate this License Agreement if you breach <br>
any term of the Agreement by giving you written notice of your breach and <br>
Zend's decision to terminate the Agreement. Upon termination of this Agreement, <br>
you agree to either return to Zend the Software, Documentation, all copies <br>
thereof, and all license keys that you have obtained, or to destroy all such <br>
materials and provide written verification of such destruction to Zend.<br>
<br>
6. Indemnifications<br>
<br>
Zend shall, at its expense, defend and indemnify you for damages and <br>
reasonable costs finally incurred in any suit or claim brought against you alleging <br>
that the Software infringes any U.S. patent, copyright, trade secret or similar <br>
right, provided that Zend is promptly notified, rendered reasonable assistance by <br>
you as required, and permitted to direct the defense or settlement negotiations. <br>
Zend shall have no obligation to defend or indemnify any infringement claim that <br>
arises from or relates to: (i) a modification of the Software by you or any third <br>
party, (ii) a combination of the Software with other software products, <br>
components, processes or materials, (iii) your failure to incorporate or implement <br>
modifications directed by Zend, (iv) third party or open source software <br>
components, (v) use of the Software in a manner inconsistent with the <br>
Documentation, or (vi) any Software provided for evaluation or trial use or <br>
marked as beta or early access. Should the use of Software by you be enjoined, <br>
or in the event Zend wishes to minimize its potential liability hereunder, Zend <br>
may, at its option, either: (i) substitute fully equivalent non-infringing software; (ii) <br>
modify the infringing Software so that it no longer infringes but remains <br>
functionally equivalent; (iii) obtain for you, at Zend's expense, the right to <br>
continue use of the Software; or (iv) take back the infringing Software and refund <br>
to you pre-paid license fees applicable to the remainder of the license term, or if <br>
a perpetual license was purchased, the purchase price paid, less depreciation <br>
amortized on a three-year straight line basis. This indemnification sets forth <br>
Zend's sole liability and your sole remedy for claims of infringement arising from <br>
your use of the Software.<br>
<br>
You will, at your own expense, indemnify and hold Zend, and its subsidiaries and <br>
affiliates, and all officers, directors, and employees thereof, harmless from and <br>
against any and all claims, actions, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, <br>
grants, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of <br>
any use of the Software by you, any party related to you, or any party acting <br>
upon your authorization in a manner that is not expressly authorized by this <br>
Agreement. Your indemnification does not include claims of infringement that are <br>
covered by Zend's indemnification above.<br>
<br>
7. Warranty; Disclaimer<br>
Zend warrants for a period of thirty (30) days from your receipt of the Software <br>
that the Software will materially conform to the Documentation. This warranty <br>
covers only problems that are reproducible and verifiable and does not cover <br>
software, or other items or any services provided by any persons other than <br>
Zend. Maintenance and support, if any, are governed by a separate agreement. <br>
Software, which has been abused, misused, damaged, modified, or subjected to <br>
unauthorized use or installation, used in a manner inconsistent with the <br>
Documentation or used with components not authorized by Zend, shall void this <br>
warranty. Zend's sole liability (and your sole and exclusive remedy) for any <br>
breach of this warranty shall be, in Zend's sole discretion, to use commercially <br>
reasonable efforts to provide you with an error-correction or workaround which <br>
corrects the reported non-conformity, or if Zend, in its sole discretion, determines <br>
such remedies to be impracticable within a reasonable period of time, to provide <br>
a refund of the fees paid for the Software.  This limited warranty does not apply <br>
for any Software provided for evaluation or trial use or marked as beta or early <br>
access.<br>
EXCEPT AS SET FORTH ABOVE IN THIS SECTION, THE SOFTWARE AND <br>
DOCUMENTATION ARE LICENSED "AS IS," AND ZEND DISCLAIMS ANY <br>
AND ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, <br>
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF <br>
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-<br>
INFRINGEMENT, TO THE EXTENT AUTHORIZED BY LAW. WITHOUT <br>
LIMITATION OF THE FOREGOING, ZEND EXPRESSLY DOES NOT <br>
WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR <br>
THAT OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR <br>
ERROR FREE. YOU ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR SELECTING THE <br>
SOFTWARE TO ACHIEVE YOUR INTENDED RESULTS, AND FOR THE <br>
RESULTS OBTAINED FROM YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE. YOU SHALL <br>
BEAR THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND THE PERFORMANCE <br>
OF THE SOFTWARE.<br>
<br>
WARNING: The Software is not designed or intended for use in on-line control of <br>
equipment in hazardous environments such as the operation of nuclear facilities, <br>
aircraft, air traffic, aircraft navigation or aircraft communications, or in the design, <br>
construction, operation or maintenance of any nuclear facility, or in the operation <br>
or maintenance of any direct life support system. Zend disclaims any express or <br>
implied warranty of fitness for such uses and shall not be liable for any costs, <br>
liabilities or damages resulting from the use of the Software in such an <br>
environment. You agree that you will not use or license the Software for such <br>
purposes. <br>
<br>
8. Limitation of Liability<br>
<br>
IN NO EVENT WILL ZEND BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, <br>
INCIDENTAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, <br>
ANY LOSS OF DATA, OR LOSS OF PROFITS OR LOST SAVINGS, ARISING <br>
OUT OF USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR <br>
DOCUMENTATION, EVEN IF ZEND HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE <br>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL ZEND BE LIABLE <br>
FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF THE FEES PAID TO ZEND FOR <br>
THE SOFTWARE WITHIN THE PERIOD OF TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR <br>
TO ANY CLAIM ARISING. <br>
<br>
9. General Terms<br>
<br>
9.1. Governing Law and Choice of Forum. This Agreement shall be governed <br>
by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Israel, without <br>
regard to the conflicts of law rules thereof. Any claim or dispute arising in <br>
connection with this Agreement shall be resolved in the applicable courts situated <br>
within the city of Tel Aviv, Israel. To the maximum extent permitted by law, you <br>

objections to the jurisdiction or venue of such courts. The United Nations <br>
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly <br>
excluded. <br>
<br>
9.2. Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is declared void or <br>
unenforceable in a particular situation, by any judicial or administrative authority, <br>
this declaration shall not affect the validity of enforceability of the remaining terms <br>
and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or <br>
provision in any other situation.<br>
<br>
9.3. Survival. Any provisions of this Agreement that, in order to fulfill the <br>
purposes of such provisions, need to survive the termination or expiration of this <br>

<br>
9.5. No Waiver; Amendments. The failure of either party to enforce any rights <br>
granted hereunder or to take action against the other party in the event of any <br>
breach hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver by that party as to subsequent <br>
enforcement of rights or subsequent actions in the event of future breaches. <br>
Amendments to the Agreement shall only be effective if in writing and signed by <br>
all parties.<br>
<br>
9.6. Assignment. You may not assign your rights under this Agreement and any <br>
attempted assignment shall be void and of no effect. Zend may assign its rights <br>
and obligations under this Agreement. <br>

Documentation are provided with Restricted Rights. Use, duplication, or <br>

subparagraph (c)(f)(ii) of the Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software <br>
clause at DFARS 252.227-7013 or subparagraphs (c) (1) and (2) of the <br>
Commercial Computer Software-Restricted Rights at 48 C.F.R. S:52.227-19, as <br>
applicable.<br>
<br>
9.8. Export Restrictions. THIS AGREEMENT IS EXPRESSLY MADE <br>
SUBJECT TO ANY LAWS, REGULATIONS, ORDERS, OR OTHER <br>
RESTRICTIONS ON THE EXPORT, REEXPORT OR IMPORT OF THE <br>
SOFTWARE OR DOCUMENTATION ABOUT SUCH SOFTWARE WHICH MAY <br>
